I hate the Spice Girls.
 I hate their music.
 I hate their fans.
 I hate their stupid faces.
   Why I saw this movie is a really, really, really long story, but I did, and one would think I'd despise every minute of it.
But, okay, I'm really ashamed of it, but I enjoyed it.
 I mean, I admit it's a really awful movie ...the ninth floor of hell ...The plot is such a mess that it's terrible.
 But I loved it.
